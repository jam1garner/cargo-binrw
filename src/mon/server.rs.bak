///
/// It bridges communication.

/// between binrw and some editor that knows how to listen.
/// 
/// But at the same time, it needs to be told (listen for something else to tell it) to
/// send important updates to the editor (or whatever else is communicating over the protocol).
/// 
/// In effect, the purpose of the RelayServer is two-fold: it relies upon something lower-level
/// to say "Hey! Something happened in the user's binrw code. Tell their editor to do stuff with
/// it." Additionally, it needs to interact with a black-box (i.e. a state machine) that knows what
/// to do with the given updates, right?

/// (2) appropriate teardown + shutdown/panic responses
/// (3) a dynamic dispatch mechanism that watches for predictable, well-defined behaviors, i.e. a
/// file changed, a compilation filed, the dynamic lib checksum changed, (whatever).
/// (4) a unified function that `broadcast`'s to everything that cares (internally)
/// (5) an extension, within (4) that sends a parcel of data to high-level, user-facing sh*t -- and
/// returns a `BinResult<()>` back to the caller of said "send"/"dispatch"/etc.
